# Mute Focused Application
Toggles mute status for the active window.

# Usage
Run the application and use the keybind to toggle the mute status of the application which is focused.

The application does the exact same thing as opening the Volume Mixer and clicking the mute button there for a specific application.

# Keybinds

F1: Toggle Mute
F3: Terminate

Note: The application only works on Windows since it uses the Windows API for majority of the tasks.
